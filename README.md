# Geo-Location-Finder
Geolocation Tracker Using Public IP Address
Overview
This Python script is a simple yet fascinating demonstration of how to track the geolocation of a device using its public IP address. It leverages the Nominatim geocoder to determine the device's current location based on its IP address. This README provides a comprehensive understanding of the project, its purpose, and how to use it effectively.

Purpose
In a world where geolocation has become increasingly essential, this script aims to automate the process of retrieving a device's location using its public IP address. This can be incredibly valuable for various applications, from finding your lost phone to enhancing the user experience on location-aware services.

Libraries Used and Their Purpose
requests:

Utilized to make an HTTP GET request to fetch the device's public IP address.
geopy (Nominatim Geocoder):

Employed to perform geolocation based on the device's IP address. Specifically, it uses the Nominatim geocoder from the geopy.geocoders module.
Code Structure and Functionality
The code is thoughtfully organized into functions and a main section, each with a specific role:

üì° get_public_ip_address Function:

Sends an HTTP GET request to "https://api.ipify.org?format=json" to fetch the device's public IP address.
Returns the public IP address as a string.
Handles potential exceptions and prints an error message if the request fails.
üåç get_location Function:

Takes a geocoder (locator) and the current public IP address as input.
Uses the geocoder to retrieve the current location based on the provided IP address.
Extracts the latitude, longitude, and address information from the geocoded location.
Returns the latitude, longitude, and address as a tuple.
Handles exceptions and prints an error message if geolocation fails.
Main Section:

Calls the get_public_ip_address function to obtain the public IP address of the device.
If the public IP address is obtained successfully, it proceeds to geolocate the device using Nominatim.
How the Code Works
The script begins by defining two functions: get_public_ip_address and get_location.

In the main section:

The script calls the get_public_ip_address function to acquire the public IP address of the device.
If the public IP address is successfully obtained, it proceeds to geolocate the device using Nominatim.
In the geolocation process:

A Nominatim locator is created with the user-agent name "geo_locator."
The get_location function is called to retrieve the device's current location based on the public IP address.
If the location is obtained successfully, the latitude, longitude, and address are extracted and printed.
If geolocation fails, an error message is printed.
The script gracefully handles exceptions and error messages in case of issues during the IP address retrieval or geolocation processes.

This project offers a foundational implementation for tracking a device's geolocation using its public IP address. You can build upon this foundation for various exciting applications or learn from its structure to expand your Python programming skills.

Usage
To use the script:

Requirements: Ensure you have Python installed on your system.

Clone the Repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/geolocation-tracker.git
